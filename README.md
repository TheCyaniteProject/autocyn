## AUTOcyn - Automate it.

AUTOcyn is a project I have wanted to work on for a while now. I have big plans for this project, so lets take a look at them.

Below is a list of all the planned features for AUTOcyn. This list might not be complete, but should give you an idea of what you will be able to do with AUTOcyn.
You can also open up `/mockplus/project-mockup.mp` in MockPlus to get a feel for what the program will eventually look like.
* Image Search/Click
This is the main feature of AUTOcyn. It basically will look for an image on screen and songle/double left/right clicking it, based on what the user desires.
* Keypresses
Specific keys, like [A], [ENTER], [SHIFT], [TAB], [CTRL]
* Typing
Type raw strings like "Hello, world!" (Then maybe use a Kepress to hit [ENTER])
* Delays
(Description will not appear for 1000 more seconds...)
* System Commads
Simply run system commands. Use this to open apps or whatever. (Maybe have your computer watch youtube while you are at work. Aimlessly scrolling through videos... and skipping ads... Sounds depressing. Could probably tie that in with Home-Tech and random-generator of tasks so that when you leave your house for whatever reason your computer will do some random task. (like watch porn XDD))
* Logic
If ImageWasFound: Search for this other image... Else: Try pressing some buttons. (Maybe turning it off an on again?)

AUTOcyns aim is to provide a decent amount of features in a easy to understand UI, and to have a really shallow learning curve opposed to other macro software.
